    <h4>Q: Is using position: absolute a bad thing? Please explain.</h4>
    <p>
        Using position absolute can be problematic if one 
        uses it relative to the browser window or without fully understanding 
        what it does. Taking an element out of the normal document flow can result
        in clashing results, but it largely depends on what am I trying to build.

    <h4>Q: What is flexbox? Where to use it and where not to use it?</h4>
    <p>
        Flexbox is a layout model that allows to align and distribute space within a 
        container, it's a great tool to use for responsive design.
        Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application and
        small scale-layout, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

    <p>
        Write comments for everyone to understand what is going on. Split functions into 
        smaller functions. Use of promises, Async/await can also help.
